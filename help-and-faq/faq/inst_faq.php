			<p>
				<b style="color:steelblue;">Qus 01: How is <?php echo(CConfig::SNC_SITE_NAME);?> beneficial for Educational Institutes?</b><br/><br/>
				<b>Ans:</b> <?php echo(CConfig::SNC_SITE_NAME);?> provides unique analysis tools for analyzing performance of students. It provides complete DNA Analysis of each individual student, just after the test (within seconds) in very cost effective manner. Thus department/faculty/trainer, can analyze weak points of students and emphasize more on focused teaching/training. It will reduce overall efforts of faculty members to conduct tests, check paper, prepare results, announce results and then explain result to individual student.
