					browser type, internet service provider (ISP), entry and exit
					pages, platform type, date and time stamp, and number of clicks to
					analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements in the

			<h3>Sharing</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Legal Disclaimer</h4>
				Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need 
				to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we 
				have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with
				a current judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served
				on our web site. In the event of an inadvertent disclosure, 
				<?php echo(CConfig::SNC_SITE_NAME);?>.com will do everything commercially

			<h3>Third Party Intermediaries</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Information Use</h4>
					<?php echo(CConfig::SNC_SITE_NAME);?>.com may use the information in order
					to send you e-mail containing items that may be of interest to you. 
					<?php echo(CConfig::SNC_SITE_NAME);?>.com will not sell, share, or release

				<li><h4>Links</h4>
					This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that 
					<?php echo(CConfig::SNC_SITE_NAME);?>.com is not responsible for the 
					privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware

					every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This 
					privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web 
					site.<br/><br/></li>
				<li><h4>Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums</h4>
					Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal
					information online-for example on message boards, through e-mail,
					or in chat areas-that information can be collected and used by
					others. In short, by posting personal information online, you may
					receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.<br/><br/></li>
				<li><h4>Security</h4>
					This web site takes every precaution to protect its users&rsquo;
					information. When users submit sensitive information via the web
					site, their information is protected both online and offline.<br />
					<br /> When users enter sensitive information, such as a credit
					card account number, that information is encrypted with SSL. While
					on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the
					bottom of web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes
					locked, as opposed to un-locked or open, when users are just
					&lsquo;surfing&rsquo;.<br /> <br /> While we use SSL encryption to
					protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our
					power to protect user information offline. All of our users&rsquo;
					information-not just the sensitive information mentioned above-is
					restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information
					to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a
					customer service representative) are granted access to personally
					identifiable information.<br /> <br />
					If users have any questions about the security at our web site, they 
					can send an e-mail to <?php echo(CConfig::OEI_SUPPORT);?>.<br/><br/></li>
				<li><h4>Correcting and Updating Personal Information</h4>
					If your personally identifiable information changes (such as zip
					code, phone, e-mail, or postal address), or if you no longer desire
					our service, we provide a way to correct or change your personally
					identifiable information. This can be done by accessing your
					personal profile in Edit Profile.<br/><br/></li>
				<li><h4>Notification of Changes</h4>
					If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will amend or update
					this.<br/><br/></li>
				<li><h4>Contact</h4>
				If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, 
				please contact us at: <?php echo(CConfig::OEI_SUPPORT);?><br/><br/></li>
